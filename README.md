# Plant Pathology
This repo is a ResNet50 model trained on Plant Pathalogy2020 FGVC7 Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/overview)

Key Highlights :- 

(1) Experimented with different convolutional neural network models finally chose ResNet50 

(2) Used Data Augmentations to prevent Over Fitting

(3) Transfer Learning 

(4) Used AUROC metric and plotted Confusion Matrix to better analyze the model and identify Dataset Imbalance

(5) Dataset Imbalance Problem tackled using modified custom loss function

(6) Hyper Parameter Tuning for better accuracy
